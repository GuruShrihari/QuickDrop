## üì¶ **Installation**

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Ngrok (for exposing the local server)

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/QuickDrop.git
   cd QuickDrop
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # For Backend
   cd backend
   npm install

   # For Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
   The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`, and an ngrok tunnel will be created automatically.

4. **Start the Frontend Development Server**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**

1. **Upload a File**:
   Drag and drop a file into the app or click to select a file from your device.

2. **Generate a Link**:
   Once uploaded, QuickDrop generates a public URL and a QR code for easy sharing.

3. **Share Instantly**:
   Share the link or QR code with others. The file is served directly from your laptop's memory via an encrypted ngrok tunnel.

4. **Terminate Session**:
   When you close the app, the session ends, ensuring no lingering access to your files.
